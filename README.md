## Description

This is my website about my life experience journey that has led me to be whom I am now.

- Create a new folder called (MoringaSchool)
- Navigate to the folder and run the command : git clone https://github.com/MesutEmpire/MoringaSchool.git

  {Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
