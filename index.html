      <li><strong> My Pet</strong></li>
      <p>
        Dogs are one of the most loyal animals. Since ages, they have served as
        the pet animals of households. Their honesty and loyalty have no match.
        They are one of the most selfless creatures and just love to be around
        their owners. They exhibit their affection by jumping around and licking
        their loved ones.
